## Overview

In the screenshot you can see the final rusult. Here is the [demo](https://devchallenges.io/solutions/q7mbQkXspuswmpNPbmgS). This was my first proyect from [DevChallenge](https://devchallenges.io/). I enjoy while I was building it and I learned some things. For example, I had some problems with the picture of a lamp but I used Photoshop to fix it. Also I improved my CSS skills because I used CSS grid and CSS flexbox.
